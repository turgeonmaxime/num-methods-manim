# num-methods-manim

Using animations to teach numerical methods.

This repository contains code to generate animations using the python library `manim`: https://www.manim.community/

These animations were developed for the course STAT 3150---Statistical Computing at the [University of Manitoba](https://sci.umanitoba.ca/statistics/).

Here is the current plan for future animations:
  - Bisection method (can be found [here](bisection.py))
  - Brent's method
  - Newton's method
  - Trapezoidal rule for numerical integration
